## Quick Start

### Windows 11 Testing

1. **Download and extract** the shopping-list folder
2. **Run setup**: Double-click `setup_windows.bat`
3. **Start app**: Double-click `run_windows.bat`
4. **Access**: Open https://localhost:7666 in your browser

### Raspberry Pi Deployment

1. **Transfer files** to your Raspberry Pi
2. **Make executable**: `chmod +x setup_pi.sh`
3. **Run setup**: `./setup_pi.sh`
4. **Configure router**: Forward port 7666 to your Pi's IP address
5. **Access**: Visit https://YOUR_PI_IP:7666 from any device

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

#### Windows 11
- Python 3.7 or later ([Download here](https://python.org))
- Make sure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation

#### Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi OS (or similar Debian-based system)
- SSH access (for remote setup)
- Internet connection

### Windows 11 Setup

1. **Download Python**: Install Python 3.7+ from python.org if not already installed
2. **Extract Files**: Download and extract the shopping-list folder to your desired location
3. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```batch
   # Double-click setup_windows.bat or run in Command Prompt
   setup_windows.bat
   ```
4. **Start Application**:
   ```batch
   # Double-click run_windows.bat or run in Command Prompt
   run_windows.bat
   ```

The app will be available at:
- HTTPS: https://localhost:7666 (if certificates generated successfully)
- HTTP: http://localhost:7666 (fallback)

### Raspberry Pi Setup

1. **Transfer Files**: Use SCP, SFTP, or copy files to your Raspberry Pi
   ```bash
   # Example using SCP
   scp -r shopping-list pi@YOUR_PI_IP:~/
   ```

2. **Connect via SSH**:
   ```bash
   ssh pi@YOUR_PI_IP
   cd ~/shopping-list
   ```

3. **Make Setup Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_pi.sh
   ```

4. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup_pi.sh
   ```

5. **Configure Service** (done automatically by setup script):
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   sudo systemctl status shopping-list
   
   # Start service
   sudo systemctl start shopping-list
   
   # View logs
   sudo journalctl -u shopping-list -f
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create or edit the `.env` file to customize settings:

```bash
# Authentication credentials
SHOPPING_USERNAME=your_username
SHOPPING_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Application security key
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key-here
```

### Default Credentials

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: password123

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Change these default credentials before exposing to the internet!

### Port Configuration

The application runs on **port 7666** by default. To change this:

1. Edit `config.py`
2. Modify the `PORT = 7666` line
3. Update your port forwarding configuration accordingly

## Router Configuration (Port Forwarding)

To access your shopping list from the internet:

1. **Find your Pi's IP address**:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

2. **Access your router's admin panel** (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)

3. **Set up port forwarding**:
   - External Port: 7666
   - Internal Port: 7666
   - Internal IP: Your Pi's IP address
   - Protocol: TCP

4. **Find your public IP**: Visit whatismyipaddress.com

5. **Access from internet**: https://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:7666

## SSL Certificates

### Automatic Generation

SSL certificates are automatically generated during setup. If you need to regenerate them:

```bash
# Windows
python generate_certs.py

# Raspberry Pi
python3 generate_certs.py
```

### Browser Security Warnings

Since we use self-signed certificates, browsers will show security warnings. This is normal and safe for personal use. Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" or similar.

### Production SSL (Optional)

For a production setup without browser warnings:

1. **Use Let's Encrypt** with a domain name
2. **Use Cloudflare Tunnel** for secure access without port forwarding
3. **Purchase a SSL certificate** from a trusted CA

## Usage

### Adding Items
- Type in the input field and press Enter or click "Add"
- Items are saved automatically

### Managing Items
- **Complete**: Click the checkbox next to an item
- **Edit**: Click on the item text to edit inline
- **Delete**: Click the ‚úï button
- **Clear Completed**: Use the "Clear Completed" button to remove all finished items

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Python not found (Windows)**:
- Install Python from python.org
- Make sure "Add Python to PATH" was checked
- Restart Command Prompt after installation

**Permission denied (Raspberry Pi)**:
```bash
chmod +x setup_pi.sh
```

**Service won't start**:
```bash
# Check logs for errors
sudo journalctl -u shopping-list -f

# Common fixes:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart shopping-list
```

**Can't access from internet**:
- Check port forwarding configuration
- Verify firewall settings
- Confirm Pi's local IP hasn't changed
- Test local access first: https://PI_LOCAL_IP:7666

**SSL certificate issues**:
```bash
# Regenerate certificates
python3 generate_certs.py
sudo systemctl restart shopping-list
```

### Logs and Debugging

**View application logs**:
```bash
# Raspberry Pi
sudo journalctl -u shopping-list -f

# Windows (run from Command Prompt in shopping-list folder)
python app.py
```

**Database issues**:
- Database file: `shopping_list.db`
- Delete to reset: `rm shopping_list.db` (will recreate automatically)

## Security Considerations

### For Personal Use
- Change default credentials
- Use HTTPS when possible
- Keep your Pi updated: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

### For Public Access
- Use strong passwords
- Consider additional authentication layers
- Monitor access logs regularly
- Keep software updated

### Network Security
- Use WPA3 WiFi security
- Consider VPN access instead of port forwarding
- Regular router firmware updates
